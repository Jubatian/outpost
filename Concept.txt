Original concepts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


This document is left as a curiosity: this was the initial design idea of the
game (from around October, 2023), outlining the coarse plans and requirements.

The eventual game doesn't match this initial design exactly, but most of it is
there. Probably the most notable difference is the diagonally shooting
ballista towers in the eventually realized game.





Concepts, ideas for a tower defense - match 3 game.


Mode 72, vertical waves of enemies

Game field:

Mode 72 is 160 pixels wide (1.5 PAR), height may be tall (216px probably)
if the remaining time can be handled well.

6x6 grid of playfield, 16x24 items (this is square due to PAR), main playfield
is 96 x 144 this way, seems to be a good size overall (horizontally half
screen, vertically around 2/3). 6 tiles make a piece, maxing it out, 42 pieces
could be made.

Sprite mode 1 is probably the best to go with it (16px wide), 4 sprites, 4
bullets. The sprite width would allow animating swaps and clears.



Game ideas:

Background - town to defend, hungry dragons (and other things).

Game field:

- Below the 6x6 grid is the town defended.
- Above is the wilderness from where attacks come.
- Resources come from above (as in collected from the wilderness).

Controls:

SNES mouse might be nice, but controller may do:

- DPAD moves selector.
- A selects / deselects tile. Selected tile swaps with DPAD.
- Long press A drops tile (costs a swap). Higher lv. tiles, longer press.
- B swaps between grid and gold options.
- Along gold options, there is a free end turn option (accumulates swaps).

Items available:

- Gold, matching 3 gives gold (all disappears).
- Iron => Cannon, column, fires upwards, splash damage.
- Stone => Tower, fires around itself.
- Wood => Ballista, fires in the row.
- Apples => Supply depot, buffs around it (4 sides).

Gold collection:

- 2 given for each gold (when matching).
- For each extra resource tile matched, +1, +2, +3 or +4 is given, for example
  matching 4 golds gives 7 gold, matching the max. possible of 7 (by a swap, 9
  is possible otherwise) gives 24 gold (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + (2 * 7) = 24).
- The extra gold is further multiplied by the tile's level + 1.
- Matching 5 of anything gives a level bonus (for example 5 or more woods
  would give a lv.2 ballista). No extra gold is given for the tiles involved
  in such combo.
- Combination bonus (multiple matches) is +3, +6, +9 ...

Gold options:

- End turn (free, accumulates swaps up to twice as normal)
- (2) +1 Swap, costs +1 for each in turn (hold button to keep adding more)
- (15) Swap any two tiles (-1 swap)
- (25) Drop all resources
- (5) +1 Population (life) (hold button to keep adding more)

Other mechanics:

- Start with 10 population, +1 every turn. Each enemy getting past defences
  takes (eats) one. Zero - game over.
- Base swaps: 5, then each 10 pop. adds 1.

Enemies:

- Flying creatures of varied sizes, corresponding health and damage (pop
  eaten).
- They fly at the same speed (video mode limitation, getting around the
  horizontal sprite limit). Maybe at 30px / sec, ~6 secs to cross the field,
  ~10 secs max per attack phase (maybe just do 30FPS here with an option to go
  at 60FPS if someone wanted things to go faster).
- One screenful of enemies, unless using ammo, more wouldn't make much sense.
